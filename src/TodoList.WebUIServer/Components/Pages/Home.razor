    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>This project demonstrates the capabilities of Blazor for building interactive web applications with C# and .NET. The backend is built using a RESTful API with clean architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles, ensuring a scalable and maintainable codebase. The Blazor frontend and the backend are separate projects, allowing for clear separation of concerns and independent development.</p>
