# CleanArchitectureBlazorTodoList

A modern, scalable, and maintainable Todo List application built with Blazor WebAssembly, following Clean Architecture principles.

## About

This project demonstrates how to implement a simple Todo List application using Blazor WebAssembly while adhering to Clean Architecture guidelines. It serves as an educational resource and a starting point for developers looking to build robust, testable, and scalable web applications with Blazor.

## Key Features

- Clean Architecture implementation
- Blazor WebAssembly frontend
- ASP.NET Core backend API
- Entity Framework Core for data persistence
- CQRS pattern with MediatR
- Unit and integration tests
- Dependency injection
- Responsive UI with Bootstrap

## Architecture

The solution is divided into four main projects:

1. Core: Contains entities, interfaces, and business logic
2. Infrastructure: Implements data access and external services
3. Application: Defines use cases and application-specific logic
4. Presentation: Blazor WebAssembly UI and API controllers

This separation of concerns allows for better maintainability, testability, and scalability of the application.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and follow the setup instructions in the README to run the project locally. Explore the codebase to learn how Clean Architecture principles are applied in a Blazor WebAssembly context.
